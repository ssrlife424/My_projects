              <h2>Visiting the Taj Mahal</h2>
              <p>
                The Taj Mahal is a place for exploring quietly on your own or
                with loved ones. So, once I’m done briefing my groups I give
                them a good 2-3 hours inside the Taj. There are ways I try to
                make the experience special and memorable for travelers, but if
                I say what they are then they will no longer be surprises! The
                Taj has such a charm. Every time I see it it looks different
                (due to the direction of the sunlight). It’s so beautiful…

              <h2>Visiting Jaipur: Pink City</h2>
              <p>
                Jaipur is warm all year long, but the most comfortable time to
                visit the Pink City is between October and February. This is
                when the days are clear and breezy and when visitors can expect
                to find the most pleasant temperatures. Visit between March and
                July and you may find yourself exploring sprawling castles that
                pre-date air conditioning in stifling heat. During these months,
                temperatures in Jaipur can soar above 100 degrees Fahrenheit

              <h2>Visiting Kerala</h2>
              <p>
                A very important thing to take care of, while travelling in
                Kerala is the airport connectivity. The 2 major airports in the
                state are in Kochi in the North and Thiruvananthapuram in the
                South. So either you start your trip from the North going
                towards the South or the other way round. This way you’ll be
                able to cover more places and use the time at your hand in the
                most optimum manner. You can view the Indian Railways schedule
