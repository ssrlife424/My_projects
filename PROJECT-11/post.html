          To visit India as a foreigner is easier than ever before. A growing
          number of cities boast gleaming new metro systems, and are linked by
          faster highways and speedier, more comfortable trains. Affordable but
          extravagant hotels and a thriving restaurant in the modern cities like
          Mumbai, make India an attractive place to visit. However, more than
          twenty percent of India’s inhabitants remain below the poverty line.
          No other nation on earth has slum settlements on the scale of those in
          Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata, nor so many malnourished children,
          uneducated women and homes without access to clean water and waste
          disposal. But for all its jarring juxtapositions, paradoxes and
          frustrations, India remains an utterly compelling destination. For
          those asking why travel to India, trust us when we say its distinctive
          patina casts a spell that few forget from the moment they step off the
          plane. Love it or hate it, India travel will shift the way you see the
          world.

          Most travellers visiting India fly into the country and it’s not
          difficult to find good flights: there are multiple direct services
          from the UK, a few from the US and Canada, and two from Australia.
          There are many airlines that fly to India, and these flights usually
          arrive into Delhi or Mumbai. From the UK you can also reach Chennai,
          Hyderabad and Bengaluru without any stops. As with any destination,
          fares vary with the seasons. For travel in India fares are highest
          from November to March, typically when it’s the best time to visit
          most of the country. The shoulder seasons of April to May and August
          to early October are cheaper, and you’ll get the best flight deals
          during the low season of June and July. Bear in mind that air fares
          are higher during India’s main festivals and events, such as Diwali in
          October/November time. For more detail, visit our page on getting to
          India.

        <h2>Culture in India</h2>
        <p>
          India, a culturally rich country made up of varied ethnic, cultural,
          linguistic, historical and religious backgrounds, is a land of
          diversity and historical masterpieces. Hinduism, Buddhism and Sikhism
          were born here although several other major religions happily live in
          harmony with one another. Often labelled as an amalgamation of several
          cultures, India has an abundance of culture, each region with its own
          distinct traditions. Food and drink in India The cuisine in India is
          popular worldwide and is as varied as the country's culture, dubbed
          the land of spices, strong flavours, aromatic curries and a range of
          meats and vegetables, the dishes change region to region. For obvious
          reasons, coastal towns boast delicious fish curries while mainland
          areas are well known for their veggie curries. Beef is almost
          non-existent in Indian cuisine, as cows are considered sacred under
          Hindu law. Must try curries include mutton Rogan Josh, macher jhol,
          vada curry and paneer tikka masala.

        <h3>Travel safety in India</h3>
        <p>
          Travel safety in India Travel in India is, generally speaking, safe
          for visitors. As expected anywhere, a tourist may be more susceptible
          to petty thefts and scams, but common sense and a few precautions go a
          long way. Crowded places - including public transport - is first and
          foremost where you should keep your awareness sharp, as this is where
          pickpockets are most likely to operate. When staying in dorm rooms,
          make sure to lock up your luggage with a padlock, and keep an eye on
          any of your luggage you store on top of a bus and ensure it’s well
          secured. If you go swimming, do not leave your belongings unattended.
          It’s also worth mentioning that not all crimes are committed by
          humans: monkeys in India have been known to steal belongings not only
          on the street but even from hotel rooms with open windows or straight
          from your shoulder.
